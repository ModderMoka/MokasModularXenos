# MokasModularXenos
Working on making this less dependent on a hundred other mods and more modular to fight the losing war against feature creep 

The first file is the core module of my More Melanin mod, it adds black skin genes as well as an Afro-textured hair gene. 
In addition to that, there are other Xenotypes added as well that use that and other modded genes from both the VRE series, excluding Phytokin, Waster, Saurid and Android, and Roos Satyr and Minotaur mods. 

The second is the psychic faction module that depends on Anima Gear and adds 3 psychic drugs and related Mystum addiction, 3 new prosthetic tiers, and one more xeno based on psycasting. 
It works best with VE Psycasts and Psyblasters and adds a new faction and pawnkinds that utilize psycaster weapons and raids if those are loaded.
